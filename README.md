# django-tardis
A re-usable app for time traveling in Django.

Tardis puts tooling around freeze_time to allow you to manage "now" in your
application. Set your destination, set stops along the way, and start your trip.
Register callbacks using signals to execute housekeeping code at each stop
during the trip.
